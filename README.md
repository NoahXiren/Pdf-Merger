# PDF Merger

This Python script helps in merging multiple PDF files into a single combined PDF file. It uses the PyPDF2 library.

## Usage

1. Place all the PDF files you want to merge in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script, and it will combine all PDF files into a single file named `combined.pdf`.

## Acknowledgements

This script is based on the work of [Internet made coder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzmJSCWa08nfnLy63vDcsOQ) on YouTube. I've made some tweaks and added functions for better usability.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoahXiren
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd PDF-Merger
   ```

3. Place your PDF files in this directory.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pdf_merger.py
   ```

   This will create a new file named `combined.pdf` with all the merged PDFs.
